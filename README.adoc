= clexc

A data driven wrapper around apache poi.

== Rationale
While there is https://github.com/mjul/docjure[docjure], i didn't want to know or
remember the terminology of apache poi. So this lib just parses and writes to and
from clojure data structures.

== Notes
The whole workbook is loaded eagerly into memory. So expect some memory usage
if you want to load a million cells.

By now there is a ton of unsupported stuff. No merged cells, cell formatting beyond
data formats, alignment, comments, cell verification, cell styles for data formats are
not reused.

== Usage

=== deps.edn

[source,clojure]
----
{;...
 :deps {;...
        io.github.fp7.clexc {:git/url "https://github.com/fp7/clexc"
                             :sha "a022a747c106fb1638d42fc988cabc51dd5fd112"}}
 }

=== Writing a sheet
